# VINNumberWindowsApp
This repository will contain the files and resources for an Vin number application 

The application will have for first version next behaviour and functions: The Vin number will be generated using a random function which will be applied to each set of characters from Vin strings = it will be a simulation of a barecode scanner.
The string components will be checked with each field to identifi what means the characters.
The data will be stored in a database file and the application will have a windos interface  with the next buttons:Simulate VIN , Show Vin numbers, Search VIN by brand or other fields.

For the next versions i will want to normalize the database using 1F,2F and 3F , add pictures with the car in the windows form as a result a search VIN by brand.

To identify each component of the VIN i will use Regex function in C Sharp.The database stucture will use SQLLite for local administration but as future improvements i will use My SQL.
The application is developed with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Comunity version.
